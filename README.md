# Labs and Homeworks related to FODS
These are my first data related homework and lab projects written at my home university within the course Foundations of Data Science.
Each Lab and Homework has their own detailed descriptions within them.
However here is a summary of the learning outcomes and libraries used in each Labs and Homeworks:

Lab 1: libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
objectives: data imputation, EDA, data visualisation, heatmap & pairplot creation, standardization, PCA

Lab 2: libraries: random, numpy, matplotplib, sklearn
objectives: clustering algorithms (K-Means, Agglomerative and DBSCAN), performance measure calculation (cluster purity, rand index, silhouette coefficient)

Lab 3: libraries: pandas, matplotlib, sklearn 
objectives: data imputation, visualisation, standardization, train-test-split, mean calculation, linear regression, lasso regression, ridge regression, k-fold cross validation, grid seach, calculation of evaluation matrices

Lab 4: libraries: pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, seaborn
objectives: data imputation, data understanding, data splitting, data scaling, classification model training, comparision of different models

HW 1: libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
objectives: data reading, imputation, data plotting, data visualisation, standardization, dimensionality reduction, multi-dimensional scaling

HW 2: libraries: pandas, io, requests
objectives: data loading, data processing, K-means clustering, DBSCAN clustering, plotting, calculation of performance measures

HW 3: libraries: sklearn, pandas, numpy
objectives: data loading, categorical features imputation, numerical features imputation, classification using single split and cross-validation, calculation of performance measures
